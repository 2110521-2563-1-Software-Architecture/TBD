1. Screenshots of Swagger for your APIs in 2. 
2. Source codes of 2 and 3. 
3. Compare how to call the methods based on gRPC and REST API side-by-side, e.g. in a Table format as shown below. 
Functions | gPRC | REST API 
--- | --- | --- 
Listbook | 301 | 283
--- | --- | ---
Insert books  | abe | sfd
4. What are the main differences between REST API and gRPC?
5. What is the benefits of introduceinterface in front of the gRPC and REST API of the book services. 
6. Based on the introduced interface, compare how to call the methods based on gRPC and REST API side-by-side, e.g. in a
Table format as shown below. 
Functions | gPRC | REST API 
--- | --- | --- 
Listbook | 301 | 283
--- | --- | ---
Insert books  | abe | sfd
7. Draw a component diagram representing the book services with and without interfaces.
